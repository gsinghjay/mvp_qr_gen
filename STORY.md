# The Tale of Our Codebase: A Journey Through the System

## Introduction

This is the story of our application - a modern web service built with FastAPI that provides both API endpoints and web interfaces, with special capabilities for QR code generation and management. Let's explore how all the pieces work together.

## System Architecture Overview

```mermaid

    Client[Client Browsers/Apps] --> Load[Load Balancer]
    Load --> App[Application Server]
    App --> DB[(Database)]
    
    App --> Static[Static Assets]

        QR[QR Code Services]
        Middleware[Middleware Layer]
        Core[Core Services]
    end

    Middleware --> Metrics[Metrics Collection]
    
    QR --> StaticQR[Static QR]
    QR --> DynamicQR[Dynamic QR]
    QR --> RedirectQR[QR Redirects]
```

## The Database Evolution

Our application's data layer has evolved over time, as shown by our Alembic migrations:

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial Schema"
    branch feature/timezone
    checkout feature/timezone
    commit id: "Add timezone awareness"
    checkout main
    merge feature/timezone
    commit id: "Current Schema"
```

The initial migration established our base schema, while the timezone-aware migration updated our timestamp fields to properly handle different time zones - critical for our global user base.

## Request Flow Through The System

```mermaid

    participant User
    participant LoadBalancer
    participant SecurityMiddleware
    participant LoggingMiddleware
    participant MetricsMiddleware
    participant Router
    participant Service
    participant Database
    
    User->>LoadBalancer: HTTP Request
    LoadBalancer->>SecurityMiddleware: Forward Request
    SecurityMiddleware->>LoggingMiddleware: Validate & Forward
    LoggingMiddleware->>MetricsMiddleware: Log & Forward
    MetricsMiddleware->>Router: Record Metrics & Route
    
    alt API Request
        Router->>Service: Call API Service (v1)
    else QR Code Request
        Router->>Service: Call QR Service (static/dynamic)
    else Web Page Request
        Router->>Service: Render Web Page
    end
    
    Service->>Database: Query/Update Data
    Database->>Service: Return Results
    Service->>User: HTTP Response
```

## Core Components Explained

### Configuration Management

The core configuration system (`app/core/config.py`) provides environment-specific settings that control the behavior of all other components. It loads variables from environment or .env files and makes them available throughout the application.

### Middleware Stack

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Request[Incoming Request] --> Security[Security Middleware]
    Security --> Logging[Logging Middleware]
    Logging --> Metrics[Metrics Middleware]
    Metrics --> Application[Application Logic]
    Application --> MetricsOut[Metrics Middleware]
    MetricsOut --> LoggingOut[Logging Middleware]
    LoggingOut --> SecurityOut[Security Middleware]
    SecurityOut --> Response[Outgoing Response]
```

Our middleware stack:
- **Security Middleware**: Handles authentication, CORS, and protection against common attacks
- **Logging Middleware**: Records request/response details for debugging and audit trails
- **Metrics Middleware**: Collects performance data for monitoring and optimization

### QR Code Generation System

The QR code subsystem is one of our application's key features, offering:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class QRService {
        +generate_qr()
        +validate_qr()
    }
    
    class StaticQR {
        +generate()
        +validate()
    }
    
    class DynamicQR {
        +generate()
        +validate()
        +update_destination()
    }
    
    class RedirectQR {
        +process_redirect()
        +track_scan()
    }
    
    QRService <|-- StaticQR
    QRService <|-- DynamicQR
    QRService <|-- RedirectQR
```

- **Static QR Codes**: Permanent codes that point to unchangeable destinations
- **Dynamic QR Codes**: Codes whose destination can be updated without regenerating the QR code
- **QR Redirects**: Handles the redirection logic when QR codes are scanned, with analytics tracking

### API Structure

Our API follows a versioned structure to ensure backward compatibility:

```mermaid
graph TD
    APIRoot["/api"] --> V1["/v1"]
    V1 --> Users["/users"]
    V1 --> Products["/products"]
    V1 --> QRManagement["/qr"]
    
    QRManagement --> CreateQR["POST /create"]
    QRManagement --> UpdateQR["PUT /{qr_id}"]
    QRManagement --> DeleteQR["DELETE /{qr_id}"]
    QRManagement --> GetQRStats["GET /{qr_id}/stats"]
```

## Deployment and CI/CD

Our application uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Push[Git Push] --> Actions[GitHub Actions]
    Actions --> Tests[Run Tests]
    Tests --> Build[Build Docker Image]
    Build --> SemanticRelease[Semantic Release]
    SemanticRelease --> Deploy[Deploy to Environment]
```

The semantic-release workflow automatically determines version numbers based on commit messages and manages the release process.

## Database Management

Database migrations are handled through Alembic, with scripts to help manage the process:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    NewFeature[New Feature Requirement] --> CreateMigration[Create Migration Script]
    CreateMigration --> TestMigration[Test Migration]
    TestMigration --> ApplyMigration[Apply Migration to Production]
    
    subgraph "Database Management Scripts"
    InitDB[Initialize Database]
    UpgradeDB[Upgrade Database]
    DowngradeDB[Downgrade Database]
    end
```

The `manage_db.py` script provides convenient commands for database operations, while `init.sh` helps with initial setup.

## Conclusion

Our application architecture demonstrates a well-structured, modern web service with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Core Configuration**: Central settings management
2. **Middleware Layer**: Cross-cutting concerns like security and logging
3. **Routers**: Request routing for different types of endpoints (API, QR, Web)
4. **Database Migrations**: Versioned database schema management
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment

This architecture allows us to maintain a robust, scalable system that can evolve over time while maintaining backward compatibility and high performance.

## CURRENT PRIORITY: Observatory-First Production-Safe Architectural Refactoring & Segno Optimization

We are now implementing a comprehensive **Observatory-First** production-safe architectural refactoring plan that addresses SOLID principle violations while integrating advanced Segno library optimizations. The plan establishes full observability infrastructure BEFORE any code changes, transforming this from a high-risk endeavor into a controlled, data-driven process.

### Observatory-First Implementation Plan:
- **Phase -1**: Observatory Setup (Tasks M.1-M.5) - Prometheus & Grafana BEFORE any refactoring
- **Safety Phase**: Critical Safety Measures (Tasks S.1-S.5) - Enhanced with monitoring in place
- **Phase 0**: Pure Additions (Tasks 0.1-0.5) - Zero risk, monitored via Grafana
- **Phase 1**: Parallel Implementation & Conditional Logic (Tasks 1.1-1.2) - Grafana-driven performance comparison
- **Phase 2**: Gradual Full Replacement (Tasks 2.X.1-2.X.3) - Grafana critical for go/no-go decisions
- **Phase 3**: Final Cleanup & Refinements (Tasks 3.1-3.5) - Dashboard refinement included

**Reference**: `docs/plans/refactor.md` - Complete Observatory-First refactoring plan

### Key Observatory-First Features:
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Every change backed by concrete Prometheus/Grafana metrics
- **Full Visibility**: Comprehensive monitoring BEFORE any architectural changes
- **Performance Baselines**: 1 week of baseline data collection before refactoring begins
- **Risk Mitigation**: Grafana dashboards for real-time system health monitoring
- **Professional Approach**: Industry-standard observability for production changes

## COMPLETED: Previous Infrastructure Work

âœ… **Repository Refactoring (Phase I)** - All 4 tasks completed
âœ… **Performance Testing & Analysis (Phase II)** - Evidence-based decision not to proceed with async migration
âœ… **Security Header Consolidation (Phase III)** - All security headers consolidated in Traefik
âœ… **Test Infrastructure Phase 1** - Directory structure, database setup, dependency overrides, factories

## Current Work Focus

### ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS: Observatory-First Refactoring (Phase -1)

**Current Phase**: Observatory Setup - Establish Full Visibility BEFORE Any Code Changes

**Completed Observatory Tasks**:
âœ… **Task M.1: Deploy Prometheus & Configure Targets** (3 SP) - COMPLETED:
   - âœ… Installed and configured Prometheus to scrape Traefik and FastAPI metrics
   - âœ… Added Prometheus to `docker-compose.yml` with proper configuration
   - âœ… Configured scraping of Traefik `/metrics` and FastAPI application metrics
   - âœ… Ensured persistent storage for metrics data
   - âœ… Verified all targets healthy: prometheus, qr-app, traefik

âœ… **Task M.2: Deploy Grafana & Connect to Prometheus** (2 SP) - COMPLETED:
   - âœ… Installed and configured Grafana with Prometheus as data source
   - âœ… Configured persistent storage for dashboards and settings
   - âœ… Secured Grafana access with strong admin password
   - âœ… Verified Grafana can query Prometheus metrics successfully
   - âœ… Confirmed application metrics accessible via Grafana proxy

âœ… **Task M.3: Create Baseline Grafana Dashboards** (3 SP) - COMPLETED:
   - âœ… Created "QR System Health Overview" dashboard with comprehensive monitoring
   - âœ… Created "QR System Refactoring Progress" dashboard for Observatory-First tracking
   - âœ… Created "QR Analytics Deep Dive" dashboard for detailed usage insights
   - âœ… All dashboards operational and displaying real-time production data
   - âœ… Verified Prometheus integration and metric queries working correctly

**Next Observatory Tasks**:

4. **Task M.4: Set Up Critical Baseline Alerts** (2 SP):
   - Configure Prometheus/Grafana alerts for high API error rate, latency, redirect failures
   - Set up notification channels (email, Slack)
   - Test alert firing by temporarily adjusting thresholds

5. **Task M.5: Capture 1 Week of Baseline Metrics** (Observation Period):
   - Allow monitoring stack to collect baseline performance data
   - Observe normal patterns, peak times, error rates
   - Adjust alert thresholds based on observed data
   - **Critical**: This data enables before/after comparisons during refactoring

**Observatory-First Principle**: "Transform refactoring from a high-risk endeavor into a controlled, data-driven process by establishing comprehensive observability FIRST."

**Total Observatory Phase Effort**: 10 Story Points + 1 week observation period

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Observatory Setup (Current Priority)**:
   - Deploy Prometheus and Grafana monitoring infrastructure
   - Create comprehensive baseline dashboards and alerts
   - Collect 1 week of baseline metrics for comparison data
   - Establish data-driven decision making foundation

2. **Safety Phase (Enhanced with Monitoring)**:
   - Execute safety tasks (S.1-S.5) with Grafana monitoring in place
   - Establish backup/rollback procedures while monitoring system impact
   - Create enhanced smoke testing with Grafana validation

3. **Phase 0: Pure Additions (Grafana-Monitored)**:
   - Deploy interface files, adapters, new services with Grafana monitoring
   - Monitor system stability during addition-only deployments
   - Verify no unexpected changes in Grafana dashboards

4. **Phase 1: Parallel Implementation (Grafana-Driven)**:
   - Use Grafana for performance comparison between old and new paths
   - Monitor circuit breaker activations and service metrics
   - Make data-driven decisions based on Grafana insights

5. **Phase 2: Gradual Service Replacement (Grafana-Critical)**:
   - Grafana dashboards critical for go/no-go decisions
   - Continuous monitoring for performance improvements/regressions
   - Before/after baseline comparisons for each service cutover

6. **Post-Refactoring**: Keycloak OIDC authentication implementation

## Recent Decisions and Insights

### Observatory-First Refactoring Approach
- **Observability Before Code**: Establishing comprehensive monitoring infrastructure BEFORE any architectural changes
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Every refactoring decision backed by concrete Prometheus/Grafana metrics
- **Risk Transformation**: Converting high-risk production refactoring into controlled, monitored process
- **Professional Standards**: Industry-standard observability practices for production changes

### Enhanced Observatory Strategy
- **Prometheus/Grafana Foundation**: Full metrics collection and visualization before refactoring begins
- **Baseline Data Collection**: 1 week of performance baselines for before/after comparisons
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Grafana dashboards critical for go/no-go decisions during cutover
- **Alert Infrastructure**: Proactive notification system for performance regressions or errors

### Repository Foundation Success
- Specialized repositories (QRCodeRepository, ScanLogRepository) provide solid foundation
- Clean separation of concerns enables easier service extraction
- End-to-end testing validates architectural changes effectively

### Performance Analysis Results
- All operations complete in <30ms with excellent consistency
- Current synchronous implementation performs exceptionally well
- FastAPI lifespan context manager effectively reduces cold start penalties
- Segno optimizations will further improve generation performance

## Current Challenges

1. **Observatory Infrastructure Setup**: Deploying and configuring Prometheus/Grafana monitoring stack
2. **Baseline Data Collection**: Establishing comprehensive performance baselines before refactoring
3. **Dashboard Design**: Creating effective Grafana dashboards for system health monitoring
4. **Alert Calibration**: Setting appropriate alert thresholds based on observed production patterns

## Active Learning

- Observatory-First approach transforms high-risk refactoring into data-driven process
- Comprehensive monitoring infrastructure is essential before production architectural changes
- Baseline metrics collection enables objective before/after performance comparisons
- Grafana dashboards provide real-time visibility for go/no-go refactoring decisions
- Professional observability practices are critical for production change management
- 1 week baseline collection period provides sufficient data for comparison analysis

## Critical Production Safety Rules

### ðŸš¨ NEVER BREAK QR REDIRECTS
The `/r/{short_id}` endpoint is business-critical. Any changes must:
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Include comprehensive testing
- Have immediate rollback capability
- Monitor redirect success rates

### Refactoring Safety Patterns
- **Feature Flag Pattern**: Use environment variables for gradual rollout
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Always implement fallback mechanisms
- **Interface-Based Design**: Abstract implementations behind interfaces
- **Metrics Logging**: Track performance and success rates for all new services

## CURRENT PRIORITY: Observatory-First Production-Safe Architectural Refactoring & Segno Optimization

We are now implementing a comprehensive **Observatory-First** production-safe architectural refactoring plan that addresses SOLID principle violations while integrating advanced Segno library optimizations. The plan establishes full observability infrastructure BEFORE any code changes, transforming this from a high-risk endeavor into a controlled, data-driven process.

### Observatory-First Implementation Plan:
- **Phase -1**: Observatory Setup (Tasks M.1-M.5) - Prometheus & Grafana BEFORE any refactoring
- **Safety Phase**: Critical Safety Measures (Tasks S.1-S.5) - Enhanced with monitoring in place
- **Phase 0**: Pure Additions (Tasks 0.1-0.5) - Zero risk, monitored via Grafana
- **Phase 1**: Parallel Implementation & Conditional Logic (Tasks 1.1-1.2) - Grafana-driven performance comparison
- **Phase 2**: Gradual Full Replacement (Tasks 2.X.1-2.X.3) - Grafana critical for go/no-go decisions
- **Phase 3**: Final Cleanup & Refinements (Tasks 3.1-3.5) - Dashboard refinement included

**Reference**: `docs/plans/refactor.md` - Complete Observatory-First refactoring plan

### Key Observatory-First Features:
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Every change backed by concrete Prometheus/Grafana metrics
- **Full Visibility**: Comprehensive monitoring BEFORE any architectural changes
- **Performance Baselines**: 1 week of baseline data collection before refactoring begins
- **Risk Mitigation**: Grafana dashboards for real-time system health monitoring
- **Professional Approach**: Industry-standard observability for production changes

- Have immediate rollback capability
- Monitor redirect success rates (now automated via alerts)

### Observatory-First Safety Patterns
- **Alert-Driven Monitoring**: Comprehensive alert system monitors all critical metrics
- **Feature Flag Pattern**: Use environment variables for gradual rollout

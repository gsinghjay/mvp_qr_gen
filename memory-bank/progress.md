## Key Technical Decisions

### Repository Architecture
- **Decision**: Specialized repositories over monolithic approach
- **Implementation**: QRCodeRepository for QR operations, ScanLogRepository for analytics
- **Benefits**: Better code organization, clearer separation of concerns, improved maintainability

### Performance Strategy
- **Decision**: Keep synchronous database operations
- **Rationale**: Excellent performance (<30ms all operations), minimal cold start penalties
- **Evidence**: Comprehensive testing showed no bottlenecks with current implementation

### Security Model
- **Decision**: Edge Gateway pattern with Traefik as single source of truth
- **Implementation**: IP allowlisting, basic auth, path-based controls at network level
- **Benefits**: Simplified architecture, reduced dependencies, centralized security

### Testing Strategy
- **Decision**: Integration tests first (80-90% coverage), unit tests to reach 100%
- **Rationale**: Better real-world validation, reduced mocking overhead
- **Implementation**: PostgreSQL test database with transaction isolation

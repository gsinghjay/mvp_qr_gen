## Current Status

### âœ… COMPLETED: Pre-Keycloak Integration Work
- **Repository Refactoring (Phase I)**: All 4 tasks completed - specialized repositories implemented
- **Performance Testing & Analysis (Phase II)**: Evidence-based decision not to proceed with async migration
- **Security Header Consolidation (Phase III)**: All security headers consolidated in Traefik

### ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS: Observatory-First Production-Safe Architectural Refactoring & Segno Optimization
- **Current Phase**: Phase -1 - Observatory Setup (Tasks M.1-M.5)
- **Progress**: âœ… Tasks M.1-M.2 COMPLETED - Prometheus & Grafana deployed and operational
- **Active Focus**: Creating baseline dashboards and alerts (Tasks M.3-M.5)
- **Key Principle**: "Transform refactoring from high-risk endeavor into controlled, data-driven process"
- **Reference**: `docs/plans/refactor.md` - Complete Observatory-First refactoring plan
- **Benefits**: Data-driven decisions, full visibility, risk mitigation, professional observability

### âœ… COMPLETED: Test Infrastructure Foundation
- **Phase 1 Complete**: Directory structure, database setup, dependency overrides, factories
- **Analysis Complete**: Comprehensive infrastructure analysis documented
- **Async Infrastructure**: Complete and robust foundation established

### ðŸš€ FUTURE PRIORITY: Keycloak OIDC Authentication
- **Status**: Deferred until post-refactoring
- **Rationale**: Clean architecture will simplify authentication integration
- **Benefits**: Enhanced security, groundwork for role-based access control

## Key Technical Decisions

### Repository Architecture
- **Decision**: Specialized repositories over monolithic approach
- **Implementation**: QRCodeRepository for QR operations, ScanLogRepository for analytics
- **Benefits**: Better code organization, clearer separation of concerns, improved maintainability

### Performance Strategy
- **Decision**: Keep synchronous database operations
- **Rationale**: Excellent performance (<30ms all operations), minimal cold start penalties
- **Evidence**: Comprehensive testing showed no bottlenecks with current implementation

### Security Model
- **Decision**: Edge Gateway pattern with Traefik as single source of truth
- **Implementation**: IP allowlisting, basic auth, path-based controls at network level
- **Benefits**: Simplified architecture, reduced dependencies, centralized security

### Testing Strategy
- **Decision**: Integration tests first (80-90% coverage), unit tests to reach 100%
- **Rationale**: Better real-world validation, reduced mocking overhead
- **Implementation**: PostgreSQL test database with transaction isolation

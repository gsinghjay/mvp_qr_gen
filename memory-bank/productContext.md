# Product Context: QR Code Generator

## Purpose & Problem Statement

### Why This Project Exists
The QR Code Generator addresses the need for a self-hosted, customizable solution to create and manage QR codes within an organization. Rather than relying on third-party services that may have limitations on customization, usage, or data privacy, this application provides complete control over the QR code lifecycle while maintaining security through network-level controls.

### Problems It Solves

1. **Control and Ownership**
   - Eliminates dependency on external QR code services
   - Ensures data privacy by keeping all QR code data within the organization
   - Enables customized retention policies and access controls

2. **Dynamic Content Management**
   - Solves the problem of printed QR codes becoming outdated
   - Allows updating destination URLs without recreating physical QR codes
   - Provides redirect capabilities for marketing campaigns or document access

3. **Usage Analytics**
   - Tracks scan counts and timestamps for dynamic QR codes
   - Enables measurement of engagement with physical materials
   - Provides insights into which QR codes are most effective

4. **Integration Capabilities**
   - Offers a RESTful API for programmatic QR code generation and management
   - Enables integration with other internal systems
   - Simplifies automation of QR code workflows

5. **Simplified Architecture**
   - Provides a streamlined solution without authentication complexity
   - Uses network-level security controls for administrative functions
   - Enables easier maintenance and reduced operational overhead
   - Allows focus on core QR functionality rather than auth infrastructure

## Target Users and Use Cases

### Primary Users
1. **Content Managers/Marketers**
   - Generate QR codes for marketing materials
   - Update destination URLs for campaigns
   - Track engagement metrics

2. **IT Administrators**
   - Manage system infrastructure
   - Configure network access controls
   - Monitor system health and usage

3. **Developers**
   - Integrate QR functionality into other applications
   - Automate QR code generation via API
   - Implement custom workflows

### Key Use Cases

1. **Marketing Materials**
   - Create QR codes for printed brochures, posters, or business cards
   - Update destination URLs for seasonal campaigns
   - Track scan metrics to measure campaign effectiveness

2. **Document Access**
   - Generate QR codes that link to digital versions of physical documents
   - Update document links as new versions become available
   - Track document access through scan metrics

3. **Event Management**
   - Create QR codes for event registration or check-in
   - Update event details or locations through dynamic QR codes
   - Track attendance through scan metrics

4. **Asset Tracking**
   - Generate QR codes to identify physical assets
   - Link to maintenance records or documentation
   - Update information as assets change location or status

## User Experience Goals

### Simplicity and Efficiency
- Provide a straightforward process for QR code creation
- Minimize steps required to generate and manage QR codes
- Enable bulk operations where appropriate
- Support rapid QR code generation with sensible defaults

### Customization and Flexibility
- Allow appearance customization (colors, size, border)
- Support multiple image formats (PNG, SVG, JPEG, WebP)
- Enable custom redirect behavior for dynamic QR codes
- Provide options for integrating logos or custom designs

### Reliability and Performance
- Ensure QR codes are always scannable and follow standards

- Maintain responsive performance even with large databases
- Enable efficient handling of concurrent requests

### Security and Access Control
- Implement IP-based restrictions for administrative functions
- Provide basic authentication for dashboard access (implemented via Traefik middleware)
- Provide rate limiting to prevent abuse (classroom-friendly for redirects, stricter for API)
- Ensure proper request validation and sanitization
- Maintain high availability for critical redirect functionality
- Implement standardized error handling throughout the application
- Validate redirect URLs against allowlists
- Monitor and alert on security events and unusual access patterns

### Integration and Extensibility
- Provide comprehensive, well-documented API
- Enable webhooks or notifications for key events
- Support standard formats and protocols
- Design for future expansion of features
- Implement Prometheus metrics for monitoring and alerting
- Support structured JSON logging for observability

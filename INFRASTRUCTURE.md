# Environment Configuration Notes

## Development Mode (Default)
- Features:
  - Hot reloading and debug features enabled
  - App directory mounted for live changes
  - Detailed logging for development
  - Testing with in-memory SQLite (run with `docker compose exec api pytest --cov -v`)

## Production Mode
- Enable by changing `ENVIRONMENT=production` in docker-compose.yml
- Features:
  - Hot reloading disabled
  - Optimized performance settings
  - Enhanced security features
  - Production-level logging

## Directory Structure
- `data/`: Contains SQLite database and backups
  - `backups/`: Database backup files
  - `logs/`: Application data logs
- `logs/`: Container logs
  - `api/`: API service logs
  - `database/`: Database operation logs
  - `traefik/`: Traefik proxy logs
- `certificates/`: TLS certificates for secure connections

## Security Notes
- TLS is enabled for secure connections
- Self-signed certificates are used for local development
- Production should use proper certificates from Let's Encrypt
- Non-root user (appuser) is used in the container for enhanced security

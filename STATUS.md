   - ✅ Created and organized `app/routes/` directory with modular route handlers
   - ✅ Proper dependency injection for database sessions exists
   - ✅ Enhanced error handling with specific error types is implemented

2. **Service Layer Implementation** - 🟡 Partially Done (61% Coverage)
   - ✅ `QRCodeService` exists with proper separation of concerns
   - ⏳ Need to move more business logic from route handlers to service classes
   - ❌ Need to add caching for frequently accessed QR codes
   - ⚠️ Service layer needs better test coverage (currently at 61%)

3. **Database Optimization** - 🟡 Partially Done (37% Coverage)
   - ✅ Basic database connection pooling is implemented
   - ✅ Proper transaction management exists
   - ✅ Database migration versioning with Alembic is set up
   - ❌ Need to add database health checks
   - ❌ Need to optimize queries with additional indexing
   - ⚠️ Database layer needs significantly better test coverage (currently at 37%)

4. **Frontend Modernization** - 🟡 Partially Done
   - ✅ Basic module structure exists in `static/js/`
   - ✅ Error handling and user feedback implemented
   - ✅ Basic state management implemented
   - ✅ Loading states implemented
   - ❌ Need to implement proper module bundling
   - ❌ Need to enhance error boundaries

5. **Testing Enhancements** - 🟡 Partially Done (77% Overall Coverage)
   - ✅ Integration tests for main endpoints exist (94% coverage in test_main.py)
   - ✅ Basic mocking for external services implemented
   - ❌ Need to add performance tests
   - ⏳ Need to enhance test coverage (currently at 77% overall)
   - ❌ Need to add API contract tests
   - ⚠️ Key areas needing coverage improvement:
     - Database layer (37%)
     - QR Service (61%)
     - Router modules (47-78%)
     - Main application code (85%)

6. **Security Improvements** - 🟡 Partially Done (85% Coverage)
   - ✅ Basic security headers middleware implemented
   - ✅ CORS configuration exists (needs production update)
   - ✅ Basic request validation implemented
   - ❌ Need to configure Traefik-level rate limiting
   - ❌ Need to enhance network isolation configuration
   - ⚠️ Security middleware has good coverage (85%) but needs production hardening

7. **Monitoring and Logging** - ✅ Mostly Complete (75-85% Coverage)
   - ✅ Structured logging implemented (85% coverage)
   - ✅ Prometheus metrics collection implemented (75% coverage)
   - ✅ Basic error tracking with categorization exists
   - ✅ Performance monitoring via Traefik metrics configured
   - ❌ Need to add health check middleware

8. **Infrastructure Improvements** - 🟡 Partially Done
   - ✅ Basic Docker configuration exists
   - ✅ Basic Traefik configuration exists
   - ❌ Need to implement proper backup strategy
   - ❌ Need to add proper CI/CD configuration
   - ❌ Need to enhance deployment strategy

**Technical Debt Items:**
1. Pydantic Deprecation Warnings (Confirmed by test output):
   - Need to migrate from V1 style `@validator` to V2 style `@field_validator`
   - Update class-based config to use ConfigDict
   - Replace deprecated `json_encoders`

**Next Steps (in priority order):**

1. ✅ Move route handlers from `main.py` to separate route modules
2. Implement health check middleware
3. Configure Traefik-level rate limiting
4. Add proper module bundling for frontend
5. Enhance test coverage and add performance tests
   - Focus on database layer (37% coverage)
   - Improve QR Service coverage (61%)
   - Enhance router modules coverage (47-78%)
6. Implement backup strategy
7. Set up CI/CD pipeline
8. Address Pydantic deprecation warnings
